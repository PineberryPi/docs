<img src="/assets/3d-models.png" alt="logo" style="width: 100%"/>

We received a lot of requests for 3D models of the Raspberry Pi 5 with the HatDrive! installed to simplify the process of designing custom housings. The resources are available on our GitHub. [3D models repository](https://github.com/PineberryPi/3d-models)

If you have designed a case for the HatDrive please share the link with us, we will include it in our upcoming gallery and reward you with a small gift. Please submit designs to office@pineberrypi.com
